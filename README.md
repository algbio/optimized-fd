# Algorithmic Optimization applied to Minimum Flow Decomposition via Integer Linear Programming

## Introduction

In the Minimum Flow Decomposition (MFD) problem, we are given a flow in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with unique source *s* and unique sink *t*, and we need to decompose it into the minimum number of weighted paths (usually the weights are positive integers) from *s* to *t*, such that for every edge the weights of the paths crossing the edge sum up to the flow value.

In the image below, an example of a flow network is displayed:

which generates the following decomposition into 5 paths:

MFD-optimized is an upgraded tool for MFD using integer linear programming by implementing several optimization that reduce the dimension of the search space (number of unkown variables).

## Pre-requisites

### Python libraries
  - Gurobipy (version 10.0.1)
    - Activate the license as instructed in [www.gurobi.com](www.gurobi.com).
  - Networkx (version 2.4)

### Practical MPC
  - Tool which finds maximum (weighted) path covers of DAGS.
  - Compile the fork in [./src/MPC](src/MPC).
  - For more information, see [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/algbio/PerformanceMPC).

## Run

To run the formulation, use `python3` to execute the `mfd_optimization.py` file.
Run `python3 ./src/mfd_optimization.py -h` for help.

### Input graph

- Use `-i/--input FILE`, where FILE contains the input DAGs and flow values.
- The input file contains a sequence of flow networks separated by lines starting with `#`.
- The first line of each flow network contains the number of vertices of the graph
- Every following line `u v f` describes an edge from vertex `u` to  `v` carrying `f` flow.
- Vertices must be integers following a topological order of the graph.

### Heuristic solution

- To use safety optimization, a given flow decomposition is needed.
- Use `--heuristic HEURISTIC`, where HEURISTIC contains a heuristic solution for every graph in the input FILE.
- Every flow network is separated by a line starting with `#`.
- Every following line represents a path `v1,v2,...` of weight `w` in the following format:
  `w: [(v1, v2), (v2, v3), (v3, v4), ...]`.

### Inexact MFD

This tool supports inexact flow decompositions, where the input graphs are not flow networks anymore but
DAGs with intervals for every edge. An inexact flow decomposition is a flow decomposition of a feasible flow
in these intervals.

- Use `--inexact` for inexact MFDs.
- Note that the input FILE must have edges of the form `u v l r`, describing edges from vertex `u` to `v` with interval `[l,r]`.
- Note that the input FILE is not allowed to have subpath constraints with inexact MFDs.

### Subpath constraints

This tool supports subpath constraints, i.e. given subpaths `S`, it  can find the minimum flow decomposition given the restriction
that every path in `S` is a subpath of some weighted path in the MFD.

- Use by including a line `subpaths` in the input FILE, after all edges, proceeded by lines of paths in the following format: `v1, v2, v3, ...`.
- Note that it can not be used with inexact flows.

### Weighted MFD

Also included is an ILP model to solve a slightly modified MFD variant, which assumes that the path weights come from a set `W`.
As of now, the set is defined to be all powers of two and includes the flow values of the input graph. This yields an approximation
of the optimal solution of ratio log2(largest flow value).

- Use `--approx` for the weighted MFD.
- Not compatible with subpath constraints.
- So far we do not print the paths, only the resulting flows which describe the number of paths passing through each edge of a certain weight.
